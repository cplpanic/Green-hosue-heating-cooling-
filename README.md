This is just a quick ReadMe to go with the project as you're fairly open to make this how you want and it's straightforward for a basic set-up.

To build this heater \ cooler You will need

-Thermoelectric Peltier      ~ £3  \ £8
-12\24 V Battery             ~ £5  \ £100
-Boost or buck converter     ~ 50p \ £2

Extra's

-PC heat sink and fan        ~ £3  \ £30
-Custom radiator             ~ £?
-Micro controller            ~ £2  \ £30
-Temperature sensor          ~ 50p \ £40
-Solar charge controller     ~ £8  \ £200
-Solar panel                 ~ £10 \ £1000
-Switch                      ~ 15p \ £3

This is just a best guess parts list and I'm honestly unsure on alot of the pricing (Supply issues) But the basics are still cheap and lead acid batteries at this time are easier to get a hold of.

Again this might be something or nothing. Just came across these peltiers and thought they where cool and that something might be done with them – even if that’s a slow build of low temperature. 

Decided to take the house version and shrink the space it needs to control down for better results. 
This can be bad as simple or complex as you like from micro controllers, sensors to plug & play on a switch.
